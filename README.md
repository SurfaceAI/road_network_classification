# SurfaceAI: pipeline for surface type and quality classification of road networks

This repository provides the code for the SurfaceAI pipeline.

For a specified bounding box, a Shapfile is generated that contains the surface type and quality classifications on a road network. Therefore, images from Mapillary are downloaded, classified using CNN models and aggregated on a provided (OpenStreetMap) road network.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

-  A Postgis database is used for efficient geocomputations. This requires prior installation of `postgresql`, `postgis`, `osmosis` (E.g., with `brew install` for MacOS and `apt install` for Linux)

- Create a `02_credentials.json` file according to `02_credentials_example.json`.
You need to provide a database user name and password with which you may access your Postgres databases (this may need to be configured on your server). You need to ensure that your database user has `superuser`rights to create extensions (postgis and hstore).
- A Mapillary access token is required and needs to be provided in the `02_credentials.json` file. You can obtain a free token as described [here](https://help.mapillary.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010234680-Accessing-imagery-and-data-through-the-Mapillary-API#h_e18c3f92-8b3c-4d26-8a1b-a880bde3a645).


### Setup Python environment

Using [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management, install poetry: 


```bash 
    pip install pipx
    pipx install poetry
```

Create an environment using poetry

```bash 
    poetry shell
```

Install required packages, as defined in `pyproject.toml`

```bash 
    poetry install
```

### Quick Start (TL;DR)

Use the `configs/01_1_area_of_interest_config_example.json` as a template for `my_config_file.json` and specify attributes `name` (str), `minLon`, `minLat`, `maxLon`, `maxLat` of the bounding box of your area of interest. `name` can be freely chosen and the output file will be named accordingly. 
Note: Recommended to limit the OSM road network (parameter `osm_region` in `00_global_config.json`) to the appropriate scope by providing a region name as available on Geofabrik ("germany" takes approx. 30GB database storage).

If environment is not active, activate with

```bash 
    poetry shell
```

Execute the pipeline with 


```bash
    python src/main.py -c my_config_file
```

The created dataset is stored in `data/output/<NAME_FROM_CONFIG>_surfaceai.shp`

If database to create further area of interest datasets is no longer needed, remove database with (OSM) road network:

```bash
    dropdb YOUR_DBNAME
```

## Advanced configuration options

Generally, the pipline initially creates a database and imports the required OSM road network. As there may be multiple *areas of interest* relying on the same road network (e.g., Dresden and Leipzig both based on the `osm_region` `sachsen`), mulitple areas of interest can use the same database to avoid downloading and processing the same data redunantly.
Note, that the pre-set default of `osm_region` is "germany", which takes approx. 30GB database storage. If you are only interested in a certain region, specify a smaller region in your configuration (see below), as the initialization runs faster and requires less storage.

### Configuration files

The configuration files are constructed to provide one global configuration (`00_global_config.json`) that sets parameters regardless of the specific *area of interest*. For each area of interest, defined by its geographical bounding box, a dedicated config file is used. 
Within the specific configuration file, you may overwrite any global parameter. 
While `00_global_config.json` is always considered, the specific area of interest config file needs to be provided to run the program, e.g., `python src/main.py -c my_config_file`.

**Configuration parameters**

-  Adjust to your area of interest(s) in `configs/my_config_file.json` (See example config file `configs/01_1_area_of_interest_config_example.json`):
    - `name` (str): chosen name for area of interest
    - `minLon`, `minLat`, `maxLon`, `maxLat` (float): bounding box of the area of interest

- Further parameters may be adjusted (however, reasonable defaults are set)
    - `dbname` (str): database name
    - `dbhost` (str): database host
    - `dbport` (int): database port
    - `osm_region` (str): region for the underlying OSM road network suitable for your area(s) of interest (note, that an `osm_region` and the respective database can be used for multiple areas of interest, however, the pipeline can only be processed with one area of interest at a time).
Names as available from Geofabrik (e.g., "germany", "berlin", "hessen"). E.g., you can specify "germany" if you have mulitple municipalities all over Germany as areas of interest. If you are only interested in a certain region, specify a smaller region, as the initialization runs faster and requires less storage.
    - `pbf_folder` (str): folder path to `osm.pbf` files. To use local files, change the path to the respective folder with this parameter. Otherwise, the needed file will be downloaded automatically from Geofabrik and deleted after import to database.
    - Mapillary API specifications: 
        - `img_size` (str): size of downloaded Mapillary images used for classification, given by the image width. Options according to the Mapillary API: `thumb_original_url`, `thumb_2048_url`, `thumb_1024_url`, `thumb_256_url`
        - `parallel`(bool): whether image download should be parallelized
        - `parallel_batch_size` (int): maximum images to download in parallel
    - Geospatial operation parameters:    
        - `proj_crs` (int): EPSG code of projected CRS to use for distance computations
        - `dist_from_road` (int): maximum distance from image to road to be considered a match, in unit of given projected CRS 
        - `segment_length` (int): length of a subsegment for aggregation algorithm, in unit of given projected CRS
        - `min_road_length` (int): minimum length of road segments to be included, in unit of given projected CRS. Short roads, which are common in OSM, like driveways, can be excluded to reduce cluttering and noise.
        - `segments_per_group` (int): number of subsegments to aggregate. E.g., if `segment_length` = 20 meters and `segments_per_group` = 3, then the output will result in 3x20=60 meter sections. If set to `null`, then the roads are maintained as given in the input of the road network.
    - Classification model specific parameters:
        - `model_root` (str): path to root folder of models
        - `hf_model_repo` (str): hugging face model repo for download of models
        - `models`(dict): required keys: `road_type`, `surface_type`, `surface_quality`(with sub keys `asphalt`, `concrete`, `paving_stones`, `sett`, `unpaved`). Each value indicates the `pt.` file location of the respective model weights 
        - `gpu_kernel` (int): if more than one GPU kernel is available, the one to be used for model inference can be specified here
        - `transform_surface` and `transform_road_type` (dict): with keys `resize` and `crop` specifying the transform operations conducted on images for these models
        - `batch_size` (int): batch size for classification model inference

You can overwrite any parameter in the specific config. E.g., the `dist_to_road` shall be 10 meters for all areas of interest, except one, then you can set `dist_to_road=10` within the global config and overwrite the parameter for only a single area of interst by setting `dist_to_road=20` within the specific config.

Note, that currently an existing database according to its `dbname` will be reused without validating if the `osm_region` matches. This means, for two runs with same dbnames but differing osm_regions, you will get invalid results.

**Alternative road network**

If you want to use a different road network than OSM, set the parameter `osm_region=None` and set `road_network_path` to your Shapefile source file location. 
The custom road network dataset is expected to have a `geom` column and a `road_type` column (with values from: `road`, `path`, `sidewalk`, `cycleway`, `bike_lane`). 
If no road type value is available, a column with `null` values will be initialized automatically. For `null` values all potential road types will be returned (i.e., every road will have an additional cycleway and sidewalk geometry). 
You may have an identifier column in your custom road network that you wish to maintain in the output. This can be specified via the config parameter `additional_id_column`.
See the example `configs/01_2_custom_road_network_area_of_interest_config_example.json`

## Output

### Road network classification

The created surfaceai output shapefile includes the following attributes:

- **ID**: (OSM) way ID
- **PART_ID**: partition ID - if multiple road types are present for a single OSM geometry (e.g.: OSM tag `sidewalk = right` present), the road is duplicated and shifted, according to the road type. Additionally, the `road_type`attribute is adjusted. The following partition IDs are set: 
    - `1`: `default` (according to `highway` tag of a geometry)
    - `2`: `sidewalk = 'right'` -> footway
    - `3`: `sidewalk = 'left'` -> footway
    - `4`: `cycleway_right = 'lane'` -> bike_lane
    - `5`: `cycleway_left = 'lane'` -> bike_lane
    - `6`: `cycleway_right = 'track'`-> cycleway
    - `7`: `cycleway_left = 'track'`-> cycleway
- **GROUP_NUM**: enumeration of divisions of the original geometry based on `segments_per_group`(see above)
- **TYPE_PRED**: aggregated surface type prediction (options: asphalt, concrete, sett, paving_stones, unpaved) (see below)
- **CONF_SCORE**: confidence score for surface type prediction quantifying the consistency of single image predictions; range 0 (low confidence) - 1 (high confidence)
- **QUALI_PRED**: surface quality prediction averaged over quality predictions of images with similar type prediction, lower values indicate higher quality (see below)
- **N_IMGS**: number of images considered for the respective road segment
- **MIN_DATE**: earliest capture date of considered images for respective road segment
- **MAX_DATE**: most recent capture date of considered images for respective road segment
- **ROAD_TYPE**: road type (options: road, footway, bike_lane, cycleway, path) based on OSM data simplified to the stated options 
- **GEOM**: Linestring geometry (WGS 84, EPSG: 4326)

### Single image classification

Next to the aggreagted results, classifications for each image may be exported as well. Therefore, use the command line option `--export_img_predictions`. A Shapefile with the following attributes will be created and stored in `data/output/<NAME_FROM_CONFIG>_img_predictions.shp`:

- **IMG_ID**: Mapillary image id
- **DATE**: capture date of image according to Mapillary
- **ROADT_PRED**: road type prediction according to the classification model, simplified into the following options: [road, footway, bike_lane, cycleway, path]
- **ROADT_PROB**: class probability of the predicted road type class according to the classification model
- **TYPE_PRED**: surface type prediction according to the classification model
- **TYPE_PROB**: class probability of the predicted surface type class according to the classification model
- **QUALI_PRED**: quality prediction according to the regression model
- **GEOM**: Point geometry according to Mapillary (WGS 84, EPSG: 4326)


## Implementation details

### Pipeline

The pipeline includes the following steps:

- setup Postgres database with PostGIS and osmosis extension
- query all image metadata within the provided bounding box from Mapillary and write to database
- create subsegments of road segments within the bounding box (based on OSM if no other network is provided)
- match images to closest road (up to a maximum distance) 
- download and classify all relevant images from Mapillary (depending on the number of images, this step may take a while)
- aggregate single classifications to road network classification (see details below)
- store Shapefile(s) with results

### Surface classification 

See https://github.com/SurfaceAI/classification_models

### Aggregation algorithm 

The aggregation algorithm runs as follows:

- **aggregate images on subsegments**; only use images that are either not within the vicinity of another road (part) or where the road type classification matches the road type of the segment (according to OSM)
    - surface type: majority vote of single image surface type predictions
    - surface quality: average of single image surface quality predictions; only images of predicted surface type are considered
- **aggregate all subsegments on road** (or group, if `segments_per_group` is given)
    - surface type: majority vote of subsegments (if tied, also use image counts)
    - surface quality: average of subsegments; only images of predicted surface type are considered

Surface type and quality prediction is `null` if 
- there is no prediction for at least 2/3 of the subsegments of a road/group
- or the most frequent type occurs in less than 50% of subsegments 
- or if there is less than 3 images for the entire road/group

Computation of the **confidence score**:
*'share of subsegments consistent with predicted type'* *   *'share of images consistent with predicted type'*
